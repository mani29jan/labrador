				<h3 class="paragraph-border">Introducing the Labrador
					Retriever:</h3>
				<p class="paragraph-border">Since its inception over 60 years
					ago, The Labrador Retriever Club has been dedicated to preserving
					the integrity of the breed as a retriever gun dog that is equally
					at home as a hunting companion, at a dog show, or sleeping on a
					child's bed. Given the breed's popularity, it is remarkable the
					degree to which Labradors have retained their ability as working
					retrievers. That achievement is a measure of the health and
					vitality of the breed. As a new Labrador Retriever owner, on our
					website we have provided you with some basic information about the
					breed and how to care for your new canine companion.

				<h3 class="paragraph-border">General Appearance</h3>
				<p class="paragraph-border">
					A Labrador Retriever is a strongly built, medium-size,
					short-coupled dog possessing an athletic, well-balanced
					conformation that enables it to function as a retrieving gun dog
					for long hours under difficult conditions. The most distinguishing
					characteristics of the Labrador Retriever are its short, dense
					weather-resistance coat; and "otter" tail; a clean-cut head with
					broad back skull and moderate stop; powerful jaws; and its "kind,"
					friendly eyes that express character, intelligence and good
					temperment.<br>The Labrador Retriever coat colors, as
					recognized in the official Standard, "are black, yellow and
					chocolate. Any other color or a combination of colors is
					disqualification." A small white spot on the chest is permissible,
					but not desirable. White hairs from aging or scarring are not to be
					misinterpreted as brindling. Black-Blacks are all black.
					Yellow-Yellows may range in color from fox-red to light cream, with
					variations in shading on the ears, back, and underparts of the dog.
					Chocolates can vary in shade from light to dark chocolate.

				<h3 class="paragraph-border">History</h3>
				<p class="paragraph-border">
					Despite the contradiction in name, the Labrador Retriever's origins
					can be found in Canada. Early in the 19th century an Englishman,
					Lord Malmsbury, purchased several Labradors (or Lesser Newfoundland
					or St. John's Dogs as they were called) from Newfoundland. He was
					attracted to the dogs because of their highly developed retrieving
					instinct and their willingness to please, and he developed a
					breeding program to preserve those characteristics.<br>From
					this early beginning the dog developed into the Labrador of
					today-one that excels in a variety of uses beyond the hunting
					field. The adaptability and trainability of the breed finds it
					utilized in many dog guide and assistance programs, as well as
					excelling in substance detection or search and rescue work. And, of
					course, with proper training and socializing, Labrador Retrievers
					are wonderful family companions.
